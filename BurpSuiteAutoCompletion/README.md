This extension supports autocompletion within BurpSuite Repeater and Intruder tabs, aimed primarily at Headers.

It comes prepackaged with the great list of headers from [SecLists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Miscellaneous/web/http-request-headers/http-request-headers-fields-large.txt)

# How To Use
1. (Optional) Clone and build this repo with `mvn clean install`
2. Load the built jar (or the one that comes with the repo) into Burp
3. Within new* Repeater/Intruder tabs begin typing a header name
4. The extension will create a list of possible candidates within a box below your cursor
5. Double click on your desired header and it will be inserted for you

\* I say new because if the Reapter/Intruder tab already exists it cannot be hooked. Simply recreate the tab to enable AutoCompletion.
